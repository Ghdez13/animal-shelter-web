# 🐾 Animal Shelter Web App

This is a React + Vite social project developed to support an animal shelter platform.  
The goal is to increase pet adoption and provide information about services, volunteering, donations, and contact options.

> **Note:** This project has evolved progressively as part of my learning journey with React and frontend development.  
> Throughout its development, I refactored several components and improved the structure to apply better practices in modularity, accessibility, and responsiveness.

📖 Project Purpose

This project represents both a functional web application and a reflection of my growth as a developer.
It demonstrates my ability to design, refactor, and adapt code following modern frontend best practices.

Although based in Mexico, I live in Playa del Carmen, a multicultural city where Spanish, English, and French are widely spoken — which inspired me to make this project fully trilingual from the start.

I firmly believe that while foundational knowledge such as algorithms and programming logic will always remain essential, technology continues to evolve.
The use of AI-assisted tools has become a valuable ally, helping us understand concepts more deeply, improve productivity, and accelerate software development without compromising quality.

🧠 MVP & Future Plans

This version is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focused on the frontend experience.
Future iterations will integrate backend functionalities such as:

- Pet data management and adoption requests

- Volunteer and donation systems

- User authentication and administrative dashboards

The goal is to evolve this project into a complete, scalable platform that supports real shelters and promotes responsible adoption.
